Source code for NABAS+

This repository contains code for the project "Accurate and highly efficient alignment-based classification of metagenomic sequences with NABAS+". This is the source code used for statistical analysis, citation extraction, and data visualization. The source code for the NABAS+ algorithm is available upon request from the correspoding author (haracska.lajos@brc.hu).
Data Availability

(a) The sequences used to create the reference mock communities were retrieved from RefSeq, and (b) the in-silico paired-end reads along with the ground truth data for the 30 mock communities can be downloaded from the following Zenodo repository under the doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7326886.

While the Illumina sequencing results of the Zymo microbial standards are accessible at the European Nucleotide Archive via the ERR2984773 and ERR2935805 accession IDs.
